# Building-Database-Agent

The code here develops AI agent that interacts with databases using natural language, simplifying the process for querying and extracting insights. 

File L1_Your_First_AI_Agent:
Use RAG to build a simple AI agent. It deploy Azure OpenAI service instance and test API, and deploy an orcheastration engine and LangChain to enable scenarios. 

File L2_Interacting_with_a_CSV_Data:
Perform natural language queries via Azure OpenAI to quickly extract information from CSV file. 

File L3_Connecting_to_a_SQL_Database:
Created a database agent which can use generative AI to translate natural language to SQL code.

File L4_Azure_OpenAI_Function_Calling_Feature:
Leverage the pre-built functions to send the queries to databases, wiouth the need to expose SQL queries during the translation process.
